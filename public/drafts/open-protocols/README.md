'Open Protocol Sepcifications (OPS)' (for the lack of a better word) are OpenAPI Specifications that are to be adopted as a standardised variant of your common use-case.

So far I'm thinking about these open protocols, which are to be outlined in this folder:

- Chat Completion Protocol (as https://console.groq.com/docs/openai)
- ActionSchema Storage Protocol
- CRUD Protocol
- Chat Communication Protocol
- Social Media Protocol
- CRM Protocol

This is a work in progress. More on this coming soon. Feel free to reach out.
